### 1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array ```prices``` where ```prices[i]``` is the price of a given stock on the ```ith``` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
